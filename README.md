# Me1lted
Me1lted is a chromeos unenrollment exploit that is built on the Sh1tt3r exploit  

## How does it work?
It makes use of the s3cret RMA shims from manufacterers to modify the uefi setting on chromebooks to allow booting into devmode, despite being enrolled  
this allows us to boot unverified javascript files with the firewall disabled, which we can use to change the chromebooks serial number in RAM, thus allowing enrollment escapes.

## Release date?
s00n.
