    <h2>What even is Me1ted?</h2>
    <p>Me1ted is a newly-discovered exploit made by v3rtual, ol.io, and fanqyxl. It unenrolls and removes enterprise enrollment from your chromebook. One day, me and Assaf Lotz were searching through commit code and found a bug that lets you modify the UEFI setting that ships out of the box on all chromebooks. This would also allow us to boot into dev mode, despite being unenrolled. It uses S3CRET RMA shims to boot into sh1mmer, load unverified javascript files when the firewall is disabled. This allows us to change the chromebooks serial number stored in ram. Once this is done, your chromebook can no longer report back to the google admin console, and is free to be used as your own.

      <h2>Okay, so, how did you find Me1ted?</h2>
      <p>One restless night searching through kv7 and v230 commit code, we found this piece of code that intruiged me and Assaf Lotz. "+/* Returns TRUE if FWMP is allowed to be updated in the current state */+static BOOL fwmp_update_allowed(void)" What this would allow us to do is once we take out the ram, this would let us set GBB flags and disable WP by remotely bridging pins 3 and 8 on the rom chip. As some of you may know, a lot of people had bricked their chromebooks trying to bridge these pins while using the retarted pencil method. Luckily opening up your chromebook is not needed anymore, as this all happens automatically.
